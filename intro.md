# Introdução

### O que é aprender?

Questão aberta, acho.

### Instrução vs. Educação.

Education: broadly; experiences in which people learn; Learning how to drive in city traffic.
Instruction: created particular experiences to make people learn how to drive in city traffic.
Training: very specific skills for almost immediate application; on-the-job skills, Elida.

Some instructions are not training, like Math and Reading, which are not designed to a specific job task and, mainly, don't have immediacy of application.

Teaching: learning experiences facilitated by a human being. Not always instruction. Always education.
